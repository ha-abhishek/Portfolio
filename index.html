            <h1>Analyzing K-Means Clustering | ILPD Dataset</h1>
            <p>The code applies K-Means clustering on the ILPD dataset to find the best number of clusters (K). It uses two methods: the Elbow Method, which looks at how the
                Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) changes with different K values, and Silhouette Analysis, which measures how well each data point fits into its assigned cluster.
                The Elbow and Silhouette plot helps decide the most suitable K. After determining K, the data is reduced to two dimensions using PCA, and the clusters are plotted
                to see how well they are grouped. The PCA_Elbow plot shows clusters based on the K found using the Elbow Method, while the PCA_Silhouette plot uses K from Silhouette
                Analysis. The black "X" markers in these plots represent cluster centroids. These visualizations help understand how well the clustering works and whether the clusters
                are clearly separated.</p>

            <h1>Performance Evaluation of MLP Classifier | Multiple Hyperparamater Configuration | Dry Bean Dataset</h1>
            <p>The code applies Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classification to the Dry Bean Dataset using multiple hyperparameter configurations and evaluates model performance
                using various metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, log loss, and epochs required for convergence. The ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) is
                computed using True Positive Rate (TPR) vs. False Positive Rate (FPR) and plotted for all model configurations. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated to
                quantify classification performance, with higher AUC values indicating better class separation. The models are trained with different activation functions
                (ReLU and Tanh), solvers (Adam and LBFGS), learning rates (constant and adaptive), and varied hidden layer architectures to analyze their impact on performance.
                These visualizations collectively help in selecting the best MLP configuration for optimal classification accuracy and efficiency.</p>
